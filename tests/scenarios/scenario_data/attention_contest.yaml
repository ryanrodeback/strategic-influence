# Scenario: Attention Contest
# Verifies that attention allocation affects probabilities

name: "Attention Contest"
description: |
  When both players allocate attention to the same neutral space,
  the probabilities reflect their relative attention.

setup:
  board_size: 5
  territories: []  # Empty board

moves:
  player1:
    "[2, 2]": 3  # 3 attention to center
  player2:
    "[2, 2]": 2  # 2 attention to center

expected_influence:
  - position: [2, 2]
    # P1: 3 attention × 10 = 30
    player1: 30.0
    # P2: 2 attention × 10 = 20
    player2: 20.0
    # Neutral: self (5.0) + 4 neighbors × 1.0 = 9.0
    neutral: 9.0

assertions:
  - description: "P1 has higher probability with more attention"
    position: [2, 2]
    # Total = 30 + 20 + 9 + K(1) = 60
    # P1 prob = 30/60 = 0.5
    # P2 prob = 20/60 = 0.333
    expected_p1_prob_approx: 0.5
    expected_p2_prob_approx: 0.333
    tolerance: 0.01
