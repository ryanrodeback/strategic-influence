# Scenario: Corner Pressure
# Verifies that corner territories face pressure from 2 board edges

name: "Corner Pressure"
description: |
  A territory in the corner receives neutral influence from 2 board edges.
  This makes corners harder to hold than center positions.

setup:
  board_size: 5
  # Place a single P1 territory in the corner
  territories:
    - position: [0, 0]
      owner: PLAYER_1

# No moves from either player
moves:
  player1: {}
  player2: {}

expected_influence:
  - position: [0, 0]
    # P1 influence: territory self-influence = 5.0
    player1: 5.0
    # P2 influence: none
    player2: 0.0
    # Neutral influence:
    #   - 2 neutral neighbors (right and up) × 1.0 = 2.0
    #   - 2 edges (bottom and left) × 1.0 = 2.0
    #   Total = 4.0 (no self since P1 owns it)
    neutral: 4.0

assertions:
  - description: "Corner territory is contested by edges"
    position: [0, 0]
    # P1 has 5.0 influence, neutral has 4.0 + K(1) = 5.0
    # Total = 5 + 0 + 5 = 10
    # P1 prob = 5/10 = 0.5
    expected_p1_prob_approx: 0.5
    tolerance: 0.01
