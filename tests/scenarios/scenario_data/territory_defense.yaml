# Scenario: Territory Defense
# Verifies that owning a territory provides defensive advantage

name: "Territory Defense"
description: |
  A player defending their own territory has an inherent advantage
  from the territory's self-influence.

setup:
  board_size: 5
  territories:
    - position: [2, 2]
      owner: PLAYER_1

moves:
  player1:
    "[2, 2]": 2  # Defend with 2 attention
  player2:
    "[2, 2]": 3  # Attack with 3 attention

expected_influence:
  - position: [2, 2]
    # P1: self-influence (5.0) + attention (2 × 10) = 25.0
    player1: 25.0
    # P2: attention only = 3 × 10 = 30.0
    player2: 30.0
    # Neutral: 4 neutral neighbors × 1.0 = 4.0 (no self since P1 owns)
    neutral: 4.0

assertions:
  - description: "Territory self-influence balances attention deficit"
    position: [2, 2]
    # P1 has 25 influence, P2 has 30, neutral has 4 + K(1) = 5
    # Total = 25 + 30 + 5 = 60
    # P1 prob = 25/60 ≈ 0.417
    # P2 prob = 30/60 = 0.5
    expected_p1_prob_approx: 0.417
    expected_p2_prob_approx: 0.5
